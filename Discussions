Recap R2 Deployment:

- Evaluation of R2 Deployment:

    How would you rate the R2 deployment? (e.g., bad, good, excellent)?
    - easier by 50%

- Identified Issues:

    What were the main issues encountered during deployment? (e.g., Helm, configurations, jenkins pipeline, etc.)
    - nodejs routes (not standard)
    - configMaps *
    - service names not standard.
    - Database schema mismatch
    - Vault configuration issues *
    - app resources (appComplmexity)
    How were these issues fixed in the production deployment? (e.g., backend fixes, adjustments via Git and subsequent redeployment, etc.)
    - appComplexity: git and backend
    - configmaps from git
    - sanity from backend

Actions for Improvement:

1. Streamline Environments:

    Why streamline environments?
        Currently, not all environments are utilized.
        Reducing the number of environments simplifies management.
        Emphasizes focus on essential environments (e.g., regression, production, development).

2. Refinement of ConfigMap Variables:

    Why refine the method for handling ConfigMap variables?
        The previous scripting method was inefficient due to:
            Creation of numerous unnecessary variables (e.g., var_com_du_cim_emailvalidation_Resources_charcter_authfile).
            Poorly formatted configurations (e.g., var_uploaddocumentorchestrated_channel_edms_rest_tibcobwce_service_EDMS_host).

3. Avoid Suffixes in Resource Names and Definitions:

    Why eliminate suffixes from resource names and definitions?
        Suffixes lack meaningful distinction, particularly when applications are upgraded.
            Question: Do both "postpayment" and "postpayment-r2" deployed and exist? If so, which one is in use? If both then why?
        Streamlining configurations for future releases.
            For instance, why update the value of "var_com_du_dxptogfbbs_createcustomeraccount_module_Processes_CallDeanonymise_DeanonymiseHost" each release if the intention is to specify the service name for that application as the value of that key?

4. Image Tagging convention name:


Values:
environment only (logging_env)
app only (appName)
app-environment (replicas, resources(cpu, memory))
